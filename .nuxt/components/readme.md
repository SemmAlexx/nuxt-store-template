# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<MainHeader>` | `<main-header>` (components/main-header/index.js)
- `<Product>` | `<product>` (components/product/index.js)
- `<Sidebar>` | `<sidebar>` (components/sidebar/index.js)
